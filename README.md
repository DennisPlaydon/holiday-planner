# Holiday Planner

This holiday planner shows you the next holiday with some information about the holiday. You enter a country code and it will return the next holiday for that country. If you don't enter anything it defaults to New Zealand's holidays. 

This is a simple one page website created with React, more specifically it was bootstrapped with create react app. It utilises ![Calenderific's](https://calendarific.com/api-documentation) API to get a list of all holidays. This application then compares all holidays and finds the next one coming up. 

## Future plans

Future plans include:
- Sorting by national holidays or filter out specific holidays.
- Show all holidays
- Cycle through upcoming holidays by clicking a `next holiday` button
